# REU Mini-Projects at Portland State University

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Portland State University. Each project represents a different aspect of mathematical modeling and computational analysis explored during the program.

## Projects

### 1. Belief Dynamics Simulation
**Abstract:** This project explores discrete-time models of belief dynamics in closed, well-mixed populations. Using Python, we implemented and analyzed four different models that simulate how social influence affects belief evolution:
- A minimal two-state model (believers/non-believers)
- A three-state model incorporating an undecided population
- A social pressure model demonstrating majority influence
- An inverse-popularity model showing minority protection mechanisms

The simulation framework allows for the study of various social phenomena, including consensus formation, polarization, and oscillating states. Through parameter manipulation, we can observe how different social influence mechanisms affect population dynamics over time. This project demonstrates how simple mathematical rules can model complex social behaviors and provides insights into belief propagation in social systems.

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Mathematical modeling
- Python programming
- Data visualization
- Social dynamics analysis
- Scientific computing

**Location:** `Mini-Project-One/`
